<p>I found that I really like to work in the world
  of code.  I started out with the free learn to code
  websites such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I liked it!
  In my pursuit of learning more about code and web development, I have taken three
  'Blueprints' for <a href="https://skillcrush.com/">Skillcrush</a>.
  Then I found that there were scholarships available for <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">
  Flatiron School</a>.  They only accept 10% of applicants.  I prayed about it and decided to 
  go for it!  I got accepted and received a scholarship that pays half of my tuition.  I feel 
  very blessed with my decision and with Flatiron School.</p>

<p>I live in Southeastern Wyoming on the prairie.  I have my house on a few acres of land.
  I don't have any cattle or horses, but I have three adorable mixed breed dogs and two
  lovable cats.  I would love to find a remote job, so I can stay in Wyoming.  I've moved
  quite a bit in my life and I really don't plan to move again. I am a very hard working and 
  loyal person.<p>
    
<p>Learning to code has been challenging and fun.  I've met many fellow code learners and 
  teachers along the way.  I am glad I made the choice to take this journey!</p>
