My mom is funny.  I mean, when I decided to leave my job that paid me a good income and I had benefits and all the stuff that comes from a job, she asked, "How are you going to pay your bills?"

Here is my answer to my mom:

I have money that I saved up and I am going to learn how to code.  "Code?" she asks.

Let me tell you what I've been learning and hopefully I can help you understand.  I had found a passion and a desire to learn how to code and find another career path.  I have been learning Ruby.  It's a programming language that a gentleman by the name of Yukihiro Matsumoto had designed. He's from Japan.  His nickname is "Matz".   Ruby is an object oriented language and it's more simple than other programming languages.  Matz wanted to make people who program to be productive, to enjoy programming and be happy with Ruby. Although I have had a little more difficult time to understand the concepts because I've learned other programming languages in high school and college.  It's almost opposite of what I've learned, but I think I'm catching on to the concepts.

"What are the concepts?" my mom asks.

The concepts of Ruby being Object Oriented. For the start, programming a large application was getting too much to control. When there had to be a change in one part of the application, programmers had to find a way to not have everything break in that application.  Then came along Object Oriented programming languages like Ruby.  Programmers could keep parts separate from other parts and thus not break the whole application.  Think about how big some of these applications can be like *Facebook* or the game you play on the weekends on the computer.  One small change could make the whole thing break and then poof! no game or *Facebook*.  Those 'parts' I mentioned are 'classes' in Ruby.

Classes encapsulate an object and each class contains the attributes and behaviors of that object it contains. I do like the idea now because I understand it better.  One of the founders, Avi Flombaum, has lectured on the subject and I've watched his videos on the subject a few times.  I even have taken the examples and worked on the computer to see how it works. It's pretty neat to see that I can put a bit of programming language into the computer and it works!

Picture the class named 'Dog' and that it encapsulates the object of a dog.  Then think about the attributes a dog has such as being a black lab, a name like Abby, or having short hair.  Then think about what kinds of behaviors dogs have such as barking or wagging it's tail.  Then there is another class named 'Cat' and that is encapsulated around the object of a cat.  Now a programmer can manipulate the dog without harming the cat or giving the cat a behavior like barking.  Cats don't bark and dogs don't meow.

There is so much to learn and I hope to graduate in September/October.  Don't worry mom. I got this and I will get that web development position in a great company! And then I can go back to paying my bills.
