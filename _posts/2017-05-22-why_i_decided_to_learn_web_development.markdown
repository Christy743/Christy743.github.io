How did I end up here writing a blog about how I decided to learn web development?  That journey started about three years ago when I was working for a large home improvement company at their distribution center.  I had a good job in the industrial engineering side of the distribution center and I really enjoyed the computer work with spreadsheets, timestudies and analyzing data.  I learned quite a bit in Microsoft Access and how to build queries and even dabble in SQL.  Then one day my manager gave me an ultimatum of transferring to the operations of the distribution center as a supervisor.  I'm still not sure what the reasons were, but it gave me a chance to reevaluate my career.

It took two years of supervising employees while ensuring their safety and productivity and working 50+ hours and then I decided I needed something else.  I wanted to have fun at my job!  Not that working with my team was not fun.  It was fun up to a point.  Like I mentioned, I worked 50+ hours and the last year was on the night shift.  I'm not cut out for working from 5 p.m. to 5:30 a.m!  I decided to do research on what would be good for me to learn and help me get that awesome job.  

The first year of my supervisory duties I applied for different types of jobs that I thought I could accomplish, but it just wasn't going anywhere.  I started to look on line and I found [codeschool.com](https://codeschool.com).  I started doing their free courses and I liked it!  Then I found [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com) and started their free lessons.  I do go back once and awhile to complete more lessons.  Then last year in March 2016 I found [skillcrush.com](https://https://skillcrush.com).  I researched to find that they are focused on code for women and I enrolled for a 'blueprint' for frontend web developer.  It was fun and I enjoyed the lessons, but I was still working and I found that it was challenging.

Then I decided last summer that I would cash out my 401k and quit my job to pursue web development full time.  I was fearful, but determined that this is what I wanted. I completed two more 'blueprints' at [skillcrush.com](https://skillcrush.com), but I felt that I wasn't as prepared to go it on my own with all that I had learned.  I love learning and I needed to build up more confidence with myself in the tech world.  I then signed up to [freecodecamp.com](https://freecodecamp.com) because they had more of a full stack curriculum and I liked the idea of volunteering for a few projects for non-profit organizations.  I still work on those lessons when I find the time.

Recently I let fear take hold of me again and just like when I first quit my job, it hits you, "What am I doing!?!?"

I let my mom, friends and others get into my brain.  I picture them like on a sitcom with their pictures in little bubbles saying things like, "How are you going to pay your bills?"

"You need to get a job!"

"What in the world are you thinking at your age?"

I am, (dare I say it?) 50 years old and I'm learning a new skill and changing my career path.  I then look at myself as brave.  I pray a lot and I did talk with God on this and I came to a conclusion.  I'm in the right direction and this is what I wanted and I have to stay on the path.  I have to see this through!  Then I remembered attending a webinar with [Power to Fly](http://https://powertofly.com) and they had a guest speaker from Flatiron School.  I received an email from Flatiron School on their full stack web development curriculum and the email spoke about a scholarship.  I researched more and what I found that attracted me was their curriculum and that they have a 98% job placement rate.  I applied and I got accepted!  How cool is that?  Even when I felt that everything in the world could get me down or hold me back, it was just fear!  I can overcome the fear and go after what I want.

These are the things I've learned through this journey:

1. Don't let fear get you!
2. Make sure you are financially set.
3. Research, research and more research.
4. Don't compare yourself with others. 
5. Don't listen to the naysayers.
6. Enjoy life!
