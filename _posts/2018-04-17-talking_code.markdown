I'm one of those people that have challenges when talking about code or anything for that matter.  I have gotten better at speaking with groups and talking about performance management and how to complete a task in a warehouse distribution setting.  But when it comes to something that I'm learning and still learning like code, I still get nervous about how I describe code. The more practice, the better.

I have started a coders' meetup group that meets two Sundays in a month at our local library.  There is a disadvantage to my area with having an interest in computer programming languages and web development.  I've had three meetings so far and only one person has shown up to each of these meetings.  This last meeting there was a person who saw me set up my computer and the projection equipment and decided to hang out and listen to my presentation on [basic HTML/CSS](https://youtu.be/WVps6x0fwYo). 

This will help me to get better with interviews and have something to show on a portfolio.  I'm proud of myself of getting out of my comfort zone! It's hard, but worth it.
